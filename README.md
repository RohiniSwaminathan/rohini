## The wild journey so far

Little did that curly haired, dark skinned, unusually skinny baby born in a remote village in South India knew what life had in store for her. All the odds were against her. Child mortality, female infanticide, caste violence, civil protests, poverty, infectious diseases, natural hazards - you name it, the graphs weren't where they should have been. 

Looking back on this wild journey so far, it is only fair to mark down how global efforts got her this far (_you think it might be a little obnoxious to think the whole world had to work for her, tune in to see why she believes that_). 

### Golden Childhood

She spent the first four years staring at the beautiful, emerald blue seas of [Rameswaram, India](https://goo.gl/maps/mUVw2cxbFnBCR3JYA)
It was also the closest point for refugees coming in from Sri Lanka. Boats and Boats and Boats arrived to the tiny island. 

Life got a sweet upgrade, as her parents moved to a remote settlement in a forest. Growing up with monkeys and mangoes and saying hello to the rare planes that passby, the next 10 years were filled with insane amount of adventures. 

### High School

Oh, She hated it. Not the studying part, She actually kind of really liked it. But looking back, it was pure insanity. 
Wake up at 5:30am, Physics 6-7, School 7:30-17, Chemistry 17:30-18:30, Math 19-20:30, Go back home and catch up on all the homeworks until midnight and repeat for four whole years. 

You get a gist of Indian High School madness.
