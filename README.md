## Hello World

...

### Golden Childhood

Spent the first four years staring at the emerald blue seas of [Rameswaram, India](https://goo.gl/maps/mUVw2cxbFnBCR3JYA)
Life got a sweet upgrade, as my parents moved to a remote settlement in a forest. Growing up with monkeys and mangoes and saying hello to the rare planes that passby, the next 10 years were filled with insane amount of adventures. 

### High School
Oh, I hated it. Not the studying part, I actually kind of really liked it. But look back, it was insane. Wake up at 5:30am, Physics 6-7, School 7:30 - 5, Chemistry 5:30 - 6:30, Math 7-8, Go back home and catch up on all the homeworks until midnight and repeat for four whole years. You get a gist of Indian High School madness.
