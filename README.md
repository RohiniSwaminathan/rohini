# The wild journey so far

## Hello World
Little did that curly haired, dark skinned, unusually skinny baby born in a remote village in South India knew what life had in store for her. All the odds were against her. Child mortality, female infanticide, caste violence, civil protests, poverty, infectious diseases, natural hazards - you name it, the graphs weren't where they should have been. 

Looking back on this wild journey so far, it is only fair to mark down how the most beautiful family she could ever ask for and insanely ambitious decade long global international development programs got her this far 

(_you think it might be a little obnoxious to think the whole world had to work for her, tune in to see why she believes that_). 

## Golden Childhood

She spent the first four years staring at the beautiful, emerald blue seas of [Rameswaram, India](https://goo.gl/maps/mUVw2cxbFnBCR3JYA)
It was also the closest point for refugees coming in from Sri Lanka. Boats and Boats and Boats arrived to the tiny island. 

Life got a sweet upgrade, as her parents moved to a remote settlement in a forest. Growing up with monkeys and mangoes and saying hello to the rare planes that passby, the next 10 years were filled with insane amount of adventures. 

## Hectic High School

Oh, She hated it. Not the studying part, She actually kind of really liked it. But looking back, it was pure insanity. 
Wake up at 5:30am, Physics 6-7, School 7:30-17, Chemistry 17:30-18:30, Math 19-20:30, Go back home and catch up on all the homeworks until midnight and repeat for four whole years. 

You get a gist of Indian High School madness. 

## Confused College Days

Engineering or Medicine? 

Given this wide variety of choices, she picked Engineering. But the odd sheep that she has always been, she picked Geoinformatics Engineering in that. And spent the next four years explaining to every Tom, Dick and Harry what exactly that is, and why she ruined her life studying something that will never get a job. 
Four years of partially fun filled college days came to an end, with her doing a weird internship every summer.

- 2008 - Inventory Mapping in Salem Steel Plant (Why, no idea - she just loved riding those raw ore carrying goods trains all day in the summer heat)
- 2009 - 3D laser mapping in Stuttgart Germany as a DAAD Scholar
- 2010 - Mapping air pollution using satellite data in Banglore, India

## Glim Grad

Packed two big bags of stuff, mainly spices and landed in the middle of corn fields with her broken English, for days she couldn't figure out what in the holy world she just did. Days became weeks and weeks became months with colorful maple leaves turning to snow storms to blooming daffodils. She went round and round Purdue University, Indiana, USA (_Hoosier forever_) and one fine summer she could do this

MS in Geomatics Engineering

Oh and how exactly did she pay for her school? She didn't. Her story telling nature along with her eagerness in HTML had her work partime at the University's Communication Department and that did. 

## Work

### NASA DEVELOP National Program

### Unemployed

Having failed to secure a work visa, she left the United States and returned home. Being unemployed thought her some of the toughest and profound lessons she would ever learn. 

She moved to Vietnam and taught English in a Cafe for a while there. (Ah Why not?)

### UN Employed 
_(pun intented)_

### UN Institute for Training and Development (UNITAR-UNOSAT)

### World Health Organization (WHO)

### UN Development Programme (UNDP)
