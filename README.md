## The wild journey so far

Little did that curly haired, dark skinned, unusually skinny baby born in a remote village in South India knew what life had in store for her. Looking back on this wild journey so far, it is only fair to mark down how global efforts got her this far (_you think it might be a little obnoxious to think the whole world had to work for her, tune in to see why I believe that_). 

### Golden Childhood

Spent the first four years staring at the emerald blue seas of [Rameswaram, India](https://goo.gl/maps/mUVw2cxbFnBCR3JYA)
Life got a sweet upgrade, as my parents moved to a remote settlement in a forest. Growing up with monkeys and mangoes and saying hello to the rare planes that passby, the next 10 years were filled with insane amount of adventures. 

### High School
Oh, I hated it. Not the studying part, I actually kind of really liked it. But look back, it was insane. Wake up at 5:30am, Physics 6-7, School 7:30 - 5, Chemistry 5:30 - 6:30, Math 7-8, Go back home and catch up on all the homeworks until midnight and repeat for four whole years. You get a gist of Indian High School madness.
